      <h2 id="current-research">Current Research</h2>
        <p>At Zurich, I studying dark energy and cosmology under the direction of Marcelle Soares-Santos. My foci is twofold: improving the instrumentation of current and future cosmological instruments, and understanding the data we obtain from them to better explain our universe.</p>
        <p>I am currently living in La Serena, Chile, contributing to the electro-optical re-verification of the Rubin Observatory LSST Camera (LSSTCam) at Cerro Pachon. In parallel to re-verifying LSSTCam, I am studying defects in LSSTCam data. This includes the picture-frame response in different detector types on the focal plane, and defect evolution in different data runs. To support the wider LSST survey, I contributed to target of opportunity strategy development for GW, neutrino, and solar system object events.</p>

        </figure>
        </div>
        <p>For the Dark Energy Survey (DES), I have tested and implemented improvements to Dark Energy Survey gravitational wave (DESGW) pipeline, including changes to the telescope strategy and real-time monitoring code. In response to LVK O4b events, I performed remote observing using the Dark Energy Camera (DECAM) for the gravitational wave (GW) trigger S240413p. I have also analyzed DECAM observations of GW events S240413p, S240422ed, and S240511i.</p>

        </figure>
        </div>
	    
	    <p>In addition to my contributions to galaxy imaging surveys in both analysis and hardware, I am leading a study of advanced astronomical instrumentation with the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI). The DESI focal plane is composed of 5,000 robotic positioners, each holding a fiber-optic cable. An unforseen challenge of the DESI focal plane design is the development of radial cracks in small pinion gears critical to the movement of the robotic positioner. To test these issues, a telescope simulator was built, with a single fiber positioner for testing installed inside. We are currently testing different operational procedures to rectify the problem through without significant hardware changes, recently identifying positioner orientation to be a leading cause of this defect.</p>

        </figure>
        </div>
        <p>In parallel to refining the existing DESI instrument, we are planning for the next generation of spectroscopic galaxy surveys. Development of the telescope simulator will enable future testing of prototype instruments. The primary design improvement would be increasing the fiber-positioner density on the focal plane, resulting in an order of magnitude increase in data volume and scientific capabilities. We are modifying our existing setup to qualify and compare performance between different robotic positioner designs for the next generation of spectroscopic surveys.</p>
        <p>
          In May 2024, I moved from the University of Michigan to the University of Zürich when my academic advisor Marcelle Soares-Santos took a position there. I earned my M.Sc in physics from the University of Michigan in May 2024.

      <h2 id="past-research">Past Research</h2>
      
      <h4 id="#UMRiles">Continuous Gravitational Waves</h4>
        <p>Previously at Michigan, I studied continuous gravitational waves from rapidly spinning neutron stars. I am developing specialized tools 
        for detecting continuous gravitational waves from post-merger binary star systems that have recently coalesced into a single compact object, usually 
        another neutron star. </p>
        <p>Think of this less cosmic example: If a perfectly spherical ball was spinning on the surface of a still body of water, the ball would not generate 
          any ripples in the water due to the uniform surface of the ball. If a rugby ball or any other non-spherical object was rapidly spinning on the 
          surface of a still body of water, it would generate ripples, due to the non-spherical surface interacting with the water differently as the ball 
          progresses through a single rotation. </p>
        <p>When neutron stars rotate very fast, they deform from a perfectly spherical star to an oblate spheroid, which looks somewhat like a rugby ball, or an American football. 
          The “ripples in the water” are instead ripples in space, which can be detected with interferometers. These continuous ripples are very weak in 
          comparison to the ripples from mergers, so I use data collected from the LIGO interferometers over their two-year observation runs.</p>
          <p>I developed code to model the gravitational wave ringdown of a neutron star binary merger, and separately developed a detection statistic to measure if a given model template
            is properly detecting an injected signal. I tested different signal models to ensure the robustness of the detection statistic under the tuning of different parameters.
          </p>

      <h4 id="MIT-AIT">Integrating the LLAMAS spectrograph at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology</h4>
      <p>I earned the opportunity to further my technical repertoire when I joined the Astronomical Instrumentation Team (AIT) at the Massachusetts 
        Institute of Technology in November 2020, under principal investigator Gábor Fûresz and faculty lead Prof. Rob Simcoe. AIT is building 
        the LLAMAS spectrograph for the Magellan Telescopes at Las Campanas Observatory in Chile, scheduled to be installed in July 2022. I assembled 
        optical mounts and ground support equipment, designed optical mounting fixtures, and tested diffraction gratings to ensure they met optical-design 
        requirements. </p>
        <div style="text-align:center">

          <figcaption>Bonding the first fiber in the LLAMAS spectrograph</figcaption>
        </figure>
        </div>
        <p>My principal responsibility was integrating the fiber run of the spectrograph. I found that my early attempt to bond fibers with the required 
          precision was too slow to meet our project deadlines. To remedy this, I wrote LabView code to allow for simple DC motor control through a 
          computer interface, removing a critical project bottleneck. These adjustments enabled exceptional accuracy in the fiber run when compared 
          to the design requirements (100% fiber yield vs. 99.5% requirement). I presented the science and engineering status of the LLAMAS instrument 
          to an astronomy class at Wheaton College in November 2021.</p>

        </div>
      <h4 id="STARSPOT">The STellar Activity Recorder and SpectroPhotometric ObservaTory</h4>
      <p>In parallel to LLAMAS, I have developed software tools to support a research proposal for AIT, concentrating on using solar spectrophotometry 
        to extend photosphere and chromosphere events on the sun to activity on exoplanet host stars. AIT has installed a multi-channel solar spectrometer
         at Lowell Observatory in Flagstaff Arizona to perform a preliminary ground-based study. I created analysis tools for this spectrometer and organized 
         meetings between AIT members and collaborators at other institutions.</p>
         <div style="text-align:center">

        </figure>
        </div>
         <p>Early in the project, I struggled with developing a data pipeline that maintained compatibility with all of the observations, as their file 
          structure was constantly being modified to accommodate the high data volume. After iteration, I constructed a robust and flexible data pipeline 
          with the capability to accurately represent all solar observations. This pipeline enabled a detailed analysis of several solar events in the 
          second half of 2021 and served as supporting evidence in a forthcoming publication that describe the project scope.</p>

      <h4 id="UCL">Cold-gas and dust evolution in star-forming galaxies</h4>
      <p>I investigated cold-gas and dust scaling relationships in star-forming galaxies in a joint venture between associate professor Amélie Saintonge 
        at University College London and Professor Maitra at Wheaton College. I built a data pipeline for use with derived data from the xCOLD GASS, JINGLE,
         and SDSS galaxy surveys. I developed a Markov-chain Monte-Carlo sampler to constrain the relationship between different matter components and the 
         Balmer emission of star-forming galaxies in the xCOLD GASS and JINGLE surveys.</p>

          <figcaption>Adjusting to the COVID-19 pandemic to work from home</figcaption>
        </figure>
        </div>
         <p>When the full effects of the COVID-19 pandemic began to impact the world, I adjusted to working from home to complete the project within the
           modified school year. I applied the smaller survey calibration to a wider set of galaxies in SDSS to discover a bias from galactic inclination. 
           Through a virtual thesis defense, I <a href="https://github.com/seanmacb/MCMC-Dust-Gas-SF-Gal/blob/master/Presentation/Defense.pptx">presented 
            these results</a> to faculty and peers from both institutions and submitted 
            <a href="https://github.com/seanmacb/MCMC-Dust-Gas-SF-Gal/blob/master/Thesis%20document%20-%20draft%20and%20Wheaton%20submission/Thesis%20submitted.pdf">
            a final report</a>, earning the highest distinction from the faculty of both colleges. </p>
            <p>Following this presentation, I generalized the calibration to include the effects of galactic inclination to better constrain the cold-gas 
              and dust content. This study will be used with the Bright Galaxy Survey from the newly commissioned Dark Energy Spectroscopy Instrument (DESI) to 
              provide a critical understanding of the evolution of baryons in the dark-energy dominated universe.</p>
      <h4 id="RI">Nanophysics for medical diagnostics</h4>
      <p>I studied at University College London (UCL) during the spring semester of my junior year. The pinnacle achievement of the spring came during a
         Group Project with other UCL students and the Royal Institute of London, determining the detection limits of lateral flow assays through photothermal 
         heating of magnetic nanoparticles.  </p>
							<p>While I was unacquainted with the other members of my group and had no previous experience in biophysics, the project provided an opportunity 
                to test my intellectual flexibility and management skills in an unfamiliar environment. I took a leading role in the project by coordinating 
                laboratory logistics, maintaining safety measures, and preparing solutions and samples for observation. </p>
							<p>I aided in the design of the sample and laser apparatus, conducted sample experiments, and analyzed photothermal heating data to determine 
                the optimal solution concentration and membrane type to maximize the photothermal signal. The results of this study were documented in 
                <a href="https://github.com/seanmacb/Group-Project-UCL/blob/master/Final_Report.pdf">a report</a>, presented at 
                <a href="https://github.com/seanmacb/Group-Project-UCL/blob/master/finalposter.pdf">a poster session</a>, and received the highest marks from 
                UCL and Royal Institute faculty.

      <h4 id="Rutgers">Tidal disruptions in dwarf satellite galaxies</h4>
      <p>In the summer following my sophomore year at Wheaton College, I earned a position in the National Science Foundation Research Experiences 
        for Undergraduates program at Rutgers University. I was paired with Professor Carlton Pryor to study dwarf satellite galaxies using astrometry
         from the second data release of the Gaia space observatory. I developed a data pipeline with photometric and kinematic filters that could be 
         applied to any Gaia data selection. After failing to discover a structural disruption in the Boötes dwarf satellite, I detected a tidal tail 
         induced by the proper motion of the dwarf satellite Carina. </p>
      <div style="text-align:center">

        <figcaption>The cohort of the 2018 REU physics and astronomy at Rutgers University</figcaption>
      </figure>
      </div>
      <p>Accepting the minor setbacks that preceded this awe-inspiring scientific discovery was a crucial moment that pivoted my research philosophy towards 
        appreciating every step of the process that precipitates success. I presented a poster at the Rutgers Summer Research Symposium and the 234th meeting 
        of the American Astronomical Society in St. Louis, Missouri. I also delivered oral presentations to faculty and peers at both Rutgers University and 
        Wheaton College.</p>

      </figure>
      </div>
      <p>Presenting at Wheaton College enabled an opportunity to become an active peer advisor to other Wheaton students, providing academic, professional, and
         personal guidance on a formal and informal basis. Studying at Rutgers offered me the chance to be a principal contributor in an astronomy research 
         project and to improve the careers and lives of fellow students, even after I graduated.</p>
      <h4 id="PANOPTES">P.A.N.O.P.T.E.S.</h4>
      <p>In my sophomore year at Wheaton College, I shifted my focus towards astronomy. I sought out Professor of astronomy, Dipankar Maitra. Professor 
        Maitra connected me with another Wheaton student, and we began collaborating on a citizen-science exoplanet collaboration called project PANOPTES. 
        In coordination with software engineer James Synge of Google, we installed a robotic telescope inside an observatory dome at Wheaton. When installing
         the unit, it became clear that some modifications to the magnetic sensors in the dome were necessary to ensure continuous compatibility.</p>
         <div style="text-align:center">

        <p> After amending the sensor placement with hand tools, I aligned the unit over three nights of precise adjustments in the frigid February 
          weather of Massachusetts while the PANOPTES team communicated through an online chat. Once operating, I presented the PANOPTES instrumentation 
          at the Northeast Astronomy Forum 2018 in Suffern New York in the hopes of attracting other amateur astronomers to expand the PANOPTES network.</p>

      <!-- <h4 id="#Astro-Wheaton">Astronomy Projects at Wheaton College</h4> 
      <p>I completed several smaller projects for an Observational Astronomy class. I derived the periods in four x-ray binary systems from archived data, 
        obtained and analyzed stellar spectra using a DSLR mounted diffraction grating, and identified outburst events in archival data from the 2015 outburst 
        of the V404 Cygni system. Working on multiple astronomy projects in parallel furthered my interest in studying the cosmos, and sharpened the project 
        management skills necessary to excel in any environment.</p>

      <!-- <h4 id="NASA-LaRC">Building Lasers: Part II</h4> 
      <p>I began an internship at NASA Langley Research Center in the summer of 2017. Dr. Brian Walsh laid out a plan to build and demonstrate a 
        proof-of-concept mid-infrared laser to monitor the atmosphere. I developed a ray transfer analysis model to predict the characteristics of 
        a Gaussian beam from varying optical components and resonator specifications. Subsequently, I performed spectroscopy on the resonator components 
        to determine the transmission and reflection of different components once the model was complete. I built and tested a near-infrared pump 
        source while the mid-infrared medium of the laser was being sent to the lab. </p>
							<div style="text-align:center;">
							<video style="width: 100%;max-height: 100%" controls > <source src="images/MyMovie1_v2.mp4" type="video/mp4"></video>
							</div>
							<p> Despite having less than a week to operate the mid-infrared component of the laser, I proved the feasibility of the design using 
                photothermal sheets. The study was a success, offering a lesson in appreciating the foundational work in a research project. 
                Properly utilizing the time before I could enter the next phase of the project provided me with the tools to excel under pressure. </p>

      <!-- <h4 id="#Wheaton-MIR">Building Lasers at Wheaton College</h4> 
      <p>I sought out research opportunities within the first month of arriving at Wheaton College. I elected to stay at school during my first winter 
        break to build solid-state lasers under the guidance of my academic advisor, Professor John Collins. The meticulous endeavor of laser development,
         operation, and characterization offered my first experience observing and exercising the techniques and methods used in professional physics research.</p>
							<p>Of all my experiences, I found that working with a complex and attentive mind like John Collins has benefitted me the most.
                 As a mentor, JC was an important component of my professional development, enforcing the importance of safety, steady hand, and enjoying 
                 your work throughout the failures and successes. JC continues to be a role-model for success at Wheaton College.</p>
