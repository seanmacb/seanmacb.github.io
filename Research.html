							<h3>Building Lasers: Part II - NASA LaRC</h3>
							<p>I began an internship at NASA Langley Research Center in the summer of 2017. Dr. Brian Walsh laid out a plan to build and demonstrate a proof-of-concept mid-infrared laser to monitor the atmosphere. I developed a ray transfer analysis model to predict the characteristics of a Gaussian beam from varying optical components and resonator specifications. Subsequently, I performed spectroscopy on the resonator components to determine the transmission and reflection of different components once the model was complete. I built and tested a near-infrared pump source while the mid-infrared medium of the laser was being sent to the lab. </p>

							<p> Despite having less than a week to operate the mid-infrared component of the laser, I proved the feasibility of the design using photothermal sheets. The study was a success, offering a lesson in appreciating the foundational work in a research project. Properly utilizing the time before I could enter the next phase of the project provided me with the tools to excel under pressure. </p>
							<h3>Building Lasers: Part I - Wheaton College</h3>
							<p>I sought out research opportunities within the first month of arriving at Wheaton College. I elected to stay at school during my first winter break to build solid-state lasers under the guidance of my academic advisor, Professor John Collins. The meticulous endeavor of laser development, operation, and characterization offered my first experience observing and exercising the techniques and methods used in professional physics research.</p>
							<p>Of all my experiences, I found that working with a complex and attentive mind like John Collins has benefitted me the most. As a mentor, JC was an important component of my professional development, enforcing the importance of safety, steady hand, and enjoying your work throughout the failures and successes. JC continues to be a role-model for success at Wheaton College.</p>
