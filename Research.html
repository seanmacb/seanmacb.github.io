							<p>When presented with a question, my primary reaction is to try to solve it. I am a problem solver by nature and am not even close to reaching my potential. I am excited for what my future holds, but in the meantime, take a look at my recent experiences building new technologies for monitoring the atmosphere, testing new methods to diagnose diseases, and creating new methods to scale dust and gas content in galaxies. </p>
							<h3>Cold-gas and dust evolution in star-forming galaxies - UCL and Wheaton College</h3>
							<p>I investigated cold-gas and dust scaling relationships in star-forming galaxies in a joint venture between associate professor Amélie Saintonge at UCL and Professor Maitra at Wheaton College. I built a data pipeline for use with derived data from the xCOLD GASS, JINGLE, and SDSS galaxy surveys. I developed a Markov-chain Monte-Carlo sampler to constrain the relationship between different matter components and the Balmer emission of star-forming galaxies in the xCOLD GASS and JINGLE surveys.</p>

							</div>
							<p>When the full effects of the COVID-19 pandemic began to impact the world, I adjusted to working from home to complete the project within the modified school year. I applied the smaller survey calibration to a wider set of galaxies in SDSS to discover a bias from galactic inclination. Through a virtual thesis defense, I <a href="https://github.com/seanmacb/MCMC-Dust-Gas-SF-Gal/blob/master/Presentation/Defense.pptx">presented these results</a> to faculty and peers from both institutions and submitted <a href="https://github.com/seanmacb/MCMC-Dust-Gas-SF-Gal/blob/master/Thesis%20document%20-%20draft%20and%20Wheaton%20submission/Thesis%20submitted.pdf">a final report</a>, earning the highest distinction from the faculty of both colleges. </p>
							<!-- Maybe put another picture in here if you get something good -->
							<p>Following this presentation, I generalized the calibration to include the effects of galactic inclination to better constrain the cold-gas and dust content. This study will be used with the Bright Galaxy Survey from the newly commissioned Dark Energy Spectroscopy Instrument to provide a critical understanding of the evolution of baryons in the dark-energy dominated universe.</p>
							<h3>Nanophysics for medical diagnostics - UCL and the Royal Institute</h3>
							<p>I studied at University College London (UCL) during the spring semester of my junior year. The pinnacle achievement of the spring came during a Group Project with other UCL students and the Royal Institute of London, determining the detection limits of lateral flow assays through photothermal heating of magnetic nanoparticles.  </p>
							<p>While I was unacquainted with the other members of my group and had no previous experience in biophysics, the project provided an opportunity to test my intellectual flexibility and management skills in an unfamiliar environment. I took a leading role in the project by coordinating laboratory logistics, maintaining safety measures, and preparing solutions and samples for observation. </p>
							<p>I aided in the design of the sample and laser apparatus, conducted sample experiments, and analyzed photothermal heating data to determine the optimal solution concentration and membrane type to maximize the photothermal signal. The results of this study were documented in <a href="https://github.com/seanmacb/Group-Project-UCL/blob/master/Final_Report.pdf">a report</a>, presented at <a href="https://github.com/seanmacb/Group-Project-UCL/blob/master/finalposter.pdf">a poster session</a>, and received the highest marks from UCL and Royal Institute faculty.

							<h3>Tidal disruptions in dwarf satellite galaxies - Rutgers REU</h3>
							<p>In the summer following my sophomore year at Wheaton College, I earned a position in the National Science Foundation Research Experiences for Undergraduates program at Rutgers University. I was paired with Professor Carlton Pryor to study dwarf satellite galaxies using astrometry from the second data release of the Gaia space observatory. I developed a data pipeline with photometric and kinematic filters that could be applied to any Gaia data selection. After failing to discover a structural disruption in the Boötes dwarf satellite, I detected a tidal tail induced by the proper motion of the dwarf satellite Carina. </p>

							</div>
							<p>Accepting the minor setbacks that preceded this awe-inspiring scientific discovery was a crucial moment that pivoted my research philosophy towards appreciating every step of the process that precipitates success. I presented a poster at the Rutgers Summer Research Symposium and the 234th meeting of the American Astronomical Society in St. Louis, Missouri. I also delivered oral presentations to faculty and peers at both Rutgers University and Wheaton College.</p>

							<p>Presenting at Wheaton College enabled an opportunity to become an active peer advisor to other Wheaton students, providing academic, professional, and personal guidance on a formal and informal basis. Studying at Rutgers offered me the chance to be a principal contributor in an astronomy research project and to improve the careers and lives of fellow students, even after I graduated.</p>
							<h3>PANOPTES</h3>
							<p>In my sophomore year at Wheaton College, I shifted my focus towards astronomy. I sought out Professor of astronomy, Dipankar Maitra. Professor Maitra connected me with another Wheaton student, and we began collaborating on a citizen-science exoplanet collaboration called project PANOPTES. In coordination with software engineer James Synge of Google, we installed a robotic telescope inside an observatory dome at Wheaton. When installing the unit, it became clear that some modifications to the magnetic sensors in the dome were necessary to ensure continuous compatibility.</p>

							</div>
							<p> After amending the sensor placement with hand tools, I aligned the unit over three nights of precise adjustments in the frigid February weather of Massachusetts while the PANOPTES team communicated through an online chat. Once operating, I presented the PANOPTES instrumentation at the Northeast Astronomy Forum 2018 in Suffern New York in the hopes of attracting other amateur astronomers to expand the PANOPTES network.</p>

							<p>I continued maintenance on the PANOPTES telescope and observatory dome until it was removed for weather-proofing upgrades in December 2018.</p>
							<h3>Intermittent astronomy projects at Wheaton College</h3>
							<p>I completed several smaller projects for an Observational Astronomy class. I derived the periods in four x-ray binary systems from archived data, obtained and analyzed stellar spectra using a DSLR mounted diffraction grating, and identified outburst events in archival data from the 2015 outburst of the V404 Cygni system. Working on multiple astronomy projects in parallel furthered my interest in studying the cosmos, and sharpened the project management skills necessary to excel in any environment.</p>

							<h3>Building Lasers: Part II - NASA LaRC</h3>
							<p>I began an internship at NASA Langley Research Center in the summer of 2017. Dr. Brian Walsh laid out a plan to build and demonstrate a proof-of-concept mid-infrared laser to monitor the atmosphere. I developed a ray transfer analysis model to predict the characteristics of a Gaussian beam from varying optical components and resonator specifications. Subsequently, I performed spectroscopy on the resonator components to determine the transmission and reflection of different components once the model was complete. I built and tested a near-infrared pump source while the mid-infrared medium of the laser was being sent to the lab. </p>
							<div style="text-align:center;">
							<video width="540" height="360" controls > <source src="images/MyMovie1_v2.mp4" type="video/mp4"></video></div>
							<p> Despite having less than a week to operate the mid-infrared component of the laser, I proved the feasibility of the design using photothermal sheets. The study was a success, offering a lesson in appreciating the foundational work in a research project. Properly utilizing the time before I could enter the next phase of the project provided me with the tools to excel under pressure. </p>
							<h3>Building Lasers: Part I - Wheaton College</h3>
							<p>I sought out research opportunities within the first month of arriving at Wheaton College. I elected to stay at school during my first winter break to build solid-state lasers under the guidance of my academic advisor, Professor John Collins. The meticulous endeavor of laser development, operation, and characterization offered my first experience observing and exercising the techniques and methods used in professional physics research.</p>
							<p>Of all my experiences, I found that working with a complex and attentive mind like John Collins has benefitted me the most. As a mentor, JC was an important component of my professional development, enforcing the importance of safety, steady hand, and enjoying your work throughout the failures and successes. JC continues to be a role-model for success at Wheaton College.</p>
